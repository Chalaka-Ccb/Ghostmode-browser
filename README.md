GhostMode is a no-install, web-based privacy tool that lets anyone securely view or share sensitive information—like personal messages, documents, or links—without leaving digital traces. It works instantly on any device (even public or borrowed computers) and guarantees that content vanishes permanently after being seen once or after a set time.
