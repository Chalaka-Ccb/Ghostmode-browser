###  GhostMode: Ephemeral, Zero-Trust Privacy for High-Stakes Moments


# What it is:
GhostMode is a no-install, web-based privacy tool that lets anyone securely view or share sensitive informationlike personal messages, documents, or linkswithout leaving digital traces. It works instantly on any device (even public or borrowed computers) and guarantees that content vanishes permanently after being seen once or after a set time.

## Core promise:

Say it. Send it. Erase it. Forever.

# How it works:

User visits ghostmode.app (no signup, no install).
Types or uploads sensitive content (text, file, image).
Chooses burn settings: Burn after 1 view or Auto-delete in 1 hour.
Gets a unique, encrypted link (e.g., ghostmode.app/abc123).
Shares the link via any channel (email, WhatsApp, Signal).
Recipient views it once  content is permanently destroyed.
No logs. No backups. No recovery. No server-side access.


## Key differentiators:

 Zero-knowledge architecture: Content is encrypted in the browsernever touches your servers in plaintext.
 Truly portable: Works on library computers, work laptops, or phonesno admin rights needed.
 Guaranteed ephemerality: Unlike email, Slack, or even private browsers, GhostMode ensures secrets cannot be recovered later.
 IP protection option: Route traffic through privacy-preserving proxies (e.g., Tor-lite or Oblivious HTTP) to hide user location.

## Who its for:

People escaping abusive relationships needing safe communication
Job seekers hiding applications from current employers
Journalists, whistleblowers, or activists in restrictive environments
Anyone whos ever pasted a password into WhatsApp and regretted it
Why its needed:
Billions use Incognito mode thinking theyre safebut their data still lives in cloud logs, ISP records, and shared devices. GhostMode fills the gap between convenience and real privacy by making ephemeral, secure sharing as easy as pasting a link.
